## Superfluous git interactions

When fetching data, git may repeatedly ask for credentials and is pretty slow.
This issue should not occur when `git` supports `sparse-checkout`. This is
because we are shelling out to Git and `git checkout`, which we utilize to very
selectively unshallow the commit at the exact path specs which we require, does
not keep the connection aliveâ€”even when you give it multiple pathspecs at the
same time through `--pathspecs-from-file=-`. With `sparse-checkout`, however,
we only call this once which lowers the number of connection attempts. A
workaround is to setup a local agent and purge that afterwards or to create a
short-lived token instead.
